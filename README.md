# Twitch4J as a library mod 

I do not own nor maintain Twitch4J, you can see the project at https://github.com/twitch4j/twitch4j  
This is only a mod to allow mods that use the API to work without having to include the API and it's deps in the mod jar

Please only report issues related to the mod, issues with the API report [here](https://github.com/twitch4j/twitch4j/issues)
For support with the mod ping me at Twitch4J discord on `#help-any-topic`, else just ask there normally on the help channels
